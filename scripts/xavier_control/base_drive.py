"""Mecanum-base teleop command builder for the Xavier Pickerbot Mini.

Robot: Wheeltec "Xavier Pickerbot Mini" (mecanum-wheel base + 4-DOF arm),
NOT the Unitree Go2 quadruped — do not reuse Go2 joint numbers here, this
is a completely different drivetrain (velocity Twist, not joint LowCmd).

Command shape: `geometry_msgs/Twist`-like dict with linear.x, linear.y,
angular.z. Mecanum wheels (unlike a differential-drive base) genuinely
support lateral motion, so linear.y is a real, independent control axis
here, not just left over from a generic Twist template.

Topic name: `/cmd_vel`, `geometry_msgs/Twist`, verified on this robot on
2026-09-18 with `/wheeltec_robot` as subscriber. The current connection
and physical motion still need checking before each supervised run; see
docs/08-kezi-vezerles.md.

SPEED CAPS BELOW ARE SAFETY-FIRST DEFAULTS, NOT MEASURED HARDWARE CEILINGS.
No load test, tape-measure timing run, or datasheet lookup has been done
for this robot's actual top speed. These numbers were chosen to be slow
enough that a first live test is very unlikely to surprise anyone, and
they should be tuned DOWN further (not up) if the robot turns out to move
faster than expected on that first test. If a real datasheet or a measured
top speed becomes available later, replace these values and update this
docstring to say so explicitly — don't just widen them.
