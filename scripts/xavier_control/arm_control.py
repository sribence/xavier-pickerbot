"""MOCK-ONLY arm/gripper command builder for the Xavier Pickerbot Mini's
4-DOF arm (Wheeltec `mini_mec_four_arm` + `mini_mec_four_arm_moveit_config`).

Status (2026-09-18, updated after a live session on the real robot): this
module NEVER talks to a real robot. It never imports rospy, actionlib,
moveit_commander, or any ROS client library, and it never constructs or
publishes to a real topic/action name. Everything `send()` produces is only
appended to `self.sent` for tests/UI to inspect. There is no env-var, flag,
or code path anywhere in this file that enables a real send — mirroring the
Go2 dashboard's lowcmd_sender.py house pattern, the real publish path is
simply NOT IMPLEMENTED here, not merely disabled, so nothing can be flipped
on by mistake.

LIVE-VERIFIED (2026-09-18, robot reachable, bringup started for read-only
inspection, base on the floor, no arm command ever sent):
- Real topic: `/arm_cmd`, type `std_msgs/Float32MultiArray`, subscribed by
  the `/wheeltec_robot` node (same node as `/cmd_vel`, not a separate MoveIt
  action server). Confirmed via `rostopic info /arm_cmd` and by reading
  `wheeltec_robot.cpp`'s `joint_states_Callback` on the robot.
- `data` is exactly 4 floats: `[j1_rad, j2_rad, j3_rad, gripper_raw]`.
  j1/j2/j3 are sent as radians, then internally scaled ×1000 and packed
  into int16 by the firmware bridge — callers of this module should still
  just pass radians, the scaling is the robot's own serial-protocol detail.
  `gripper_raw` is cast straight to `uint8_t` with NO scaling in the C++
  driver. The robot's `stepper_arm` sources were checked on 2026-09-23:
  the supported range is 0..100, where 0 means open and 100 means closed;
  the vendor keyboard controller changes it in increments of 5.
- Real joint names/limits, read from `mini_mec_moveit_four.urdf` on the
  robot (`turn_on_wheeltec_robot/urdf/mini_mec_moveit_four.urdf`): only
  `j1_joint`, `j2_joint`, `j3_joint` are independently commandable via
  `/arm_cmd`; each is `type="revolute"`, limit `lower="-0.785" upper="0.785"`
  (±45°), `effort="100"` (unit unclear — likely a generic MoveIt-exporter
  placeholder, not a measured torque spec), `velocity="0"` (unspecified by
  the URDF, NOT "unlimited" — do not assume any particular safe speed from
  this). The `j4_1_joint`..`j4_6_joint` names seen in `/joint_states` are a
  mechanically-linked gripper finger assembly, not independently
  commandable — the single `gripper_raw` value in `/arm_cmd` drives all of
  them together.

STILL UNVERIFIED / left mock-only on purpose:
- Real accel/velocity behavior in practice — the URDF `velocity="0"` field
  gives no usable ceiling, so no rate-limit number here is backed by a
  measurement (unlike `base_drive.py`, which errs toward a conservative
  guessed teleop cap; the arm has a collision risk with the gripper/base/
  whatever it's holding, so a real send path is not being added until an
  operator does a deliberate, supervised first physical joint-by-joint
  test after the documented grinding/beeping joint fault is inspected.
- The lower controller sends no measured arm position back to ROS. Even a
  gripper-only change must repeat all three joint targets, so it cannot be
  sent safely until the physical pose is known and synchronized.

Given the above, this module keeps j1/j2/j3 limits as REAL (not
placeholder) — `JOINT_LIMITS_RAD` below is the actual URDF data — but
stays mock-only end to end until a deliberate follow-up task builds a real
sender AND someone has watched the arm move on the first few commands with
a hand near the power switch.

4-DOF ARM NOTE: with only 3 independently-commandable arm joints + 1
gripper DOF, this arm cannot reach an arbitrary 6D (position + orientation)
pose — that needs at least 6 DOF. Only a position-based target makes
sense here; full pose IK is not offered by this module.
